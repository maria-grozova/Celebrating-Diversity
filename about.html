                    <h2>UK equality law</h2>
                    <p>The Equality Act 2010 is a cross-cutting legislative framework to protect the rights of
                        individuals and
                        advance equality of opportunity for all. It delivers a simple, modern and accessible framework
                        of
                        discrimination law which protects individuals from unfair treatment and promotes a fair and more
                        equal
                        society.
                        The Act protects people from discrimination at
                        work and in the provision of goods and services on the basis of the following nine protected

                                        We often make assumptions about what people are like or what they can do based
                                        on
                                        stereotypes around age. For example, we may assume that it’s only young people
                                        who can do
                                        jobs requiring physical fitness, strength and fast reactions. But many older
                                        people are
                                        strong, healthy and quick-thinking - and it's wrong to think that all young
                                        people will
                                        necessarily possess these attributes.
                                        When we make assumptions, we close our eyes to the wider possibilities. The
                                        qualities
                                        required for any task go far beyond age. What’s important is having the
                                        competencies and
                                        personal qualities

                                        Barriers that disabled people face
                                        The social model of disability identifies barriers which prevent disabled people
                                        from
                                        participating fully in all aspects of life. There are three main types of
                                        barrier:
                                        <br><br>
                                        Environmental Barriers:
                                        <br>
                                        Environmental discrimination occurs where public services, buildings and
                                        transport are not
                                        designed with access for disabled citizens in mind. It’s important to remember
                                        this is not
                                        only about lifts and ramps - it also includes physical barriers such as poor
                                        lighting,
                                        acoustics and signage. For example, some people with dyslexia may prefer white
                                        backgrounds
                                        and black text on printed documents and PowerPoint slides, as detailed and
                                        colourful
                                        PowerPoint slides can be difficult to read.

                                        Institutional barriers:
                                        <br>
                                        Institutional discrimination occurs when the law or organisational procedures
                                        and practices
                                        discriminate (explicitly or by omission) against the rights of disabled people,
                                        making them
                                        in some way second-class citizens. This includes poor communication – not
                                        providing vital
                                        information in an accessible way, and not ensuring staff are trained to be able
                                        to
                                        communicate with the diversity of their colleagues and customers.
                                        Rigid health and safety procedures that debar a disabled person from
                                        participating, when
                                        access could easily be arranged by simple changes of practice, are other
                                        examples. Health
                                        and safety should never be used to exclude a person unless there is no other
                                        available
                                        option.

                                        Attitudinal barriers:
                                        <br>
                                        Disabled people may be socially excluded by attitudes of fear and ignorance on
                                        the part of
                                        non-disabled people, who may use negative language about them; or they may be
                                        excluded from
                                        society because of generally low expectations of what disabled people can
                                        achieve. Many
                                        disabled people feel these are the most difficult barriers to challenge.
                                        For example, the Equality and Human Rights Commission has found that disabled
                                        people
                                        experience a higher rate of targeted hostility and violence – physical and
                                        verbal – than
                                        non- disabled people; they are four times more likely to be victims of crime;
                                        and that every
                                        day of the year, someone appears in court charged with a disability-related
                                        crime of
                                        violence.

                                        Gender reassignment is the process of transitioning from one gender to another.
                                        This is a
                                        personal process, not a medical one - so it is not necessary to undergo
                                        gender-affirming
                                        surgery or be under any kind of medical supervision to be classed and legally
                                        protected.
                                        Many ‘binary’ trans people never undergo gender-affirming surgery or hormone
                                        treatment, but
                                        instead simply opt to live in their preferred or ‘affirmed’ gender.

                                        Many trans and non-binary people encounter inappropriate behaviour and negative
                                        attitudes.

                                    UK law reflects marriage status in multiple possible ways. The most common two of
                                    these are as a married partnership, and a civil partnership.<br><br>
                                    Marriage is also a protected characteristic under the Equalities Act 2010. Due to
                                    this, you are not allowed to be discriminated if you are in a marriage or civil
                                    partnership, on the basis of that factor. This means that those who are married or
                                    in a civil partnership cannot be put at a disadvantage, in work or life, due to
                                    their marital status.<br><br>
                                    For example, a manager is not allowed to place married or partnered members of staff
                                    into specific workstreams, in anticipation of them 'not being able to work long
                                    hours' compared to their single coworkers.

                                    Having a baby is a life-changing experience that will inevitably involve major

                                    Race in the UK: Key facts
                                    More than one person in 10 in the UK comes from an ethnic minority group.
                                    30 per cent of Black, Asian or ethnic minority workers have either witnessed or
                                    experienced
                                    racial harassment in the workplace in the past year (Business in the Community
                                    report, 2015).

                                    Asian, Black and other ethnic groups are disproportionately likely to be on a low
                                    income (UK
                                    Race Disparity Audit 2017).

                                    Ethnic minorities are more likely to live in areas of deprivation, especially Black,

                                    and Bangladeshi people (UK Race Disparity Audit 2017).

                                    Ethnic minorities are significantly under-represented at senior levels across the
                                    public sector
                                    (UK Race Disparity Audit 2017).

                                    The role of stereotypes:
                                    <br>
                                    Stereotypes are a major contributing factor to the persistence of racist attitudes
                                    and beliefs.
                                    The media, through TV dramas and by publicising the views of influential people
                                    (such as
                                    politicians and celebrities), reinforce many of the stereotypes that we hold about
                                    people from
                                    different ethnic backgrounds, both positive and negative.
                                    A stereotype is a fixed, commonly held notion or image of a person or group, based
                                    on an
                                    oversimplification of some observed or imagined trait of behaviour or appearance.
                                    Stereotypes
                                    can be embedded in a single word or phrase, such as ‘nerd’ or ‘anorak’, image or
                                    combination of
                                    words and images. People who share the same views easily recognise and understand
                                    the image the
                                    word or phrase evokes.
                                    <br>
                                    Stereotypes can be positive (e.g. ‘women are naturally caring’) or negative (e.g.
                                    ‘teenagers are
                                    lazy’). But most stereotypes tend to make us feel superior in some way to the person
                                    or group
                                    being stereotyped. Stereotypes ignore the fact that each individual is unique by
                                    endowing all
                                    members of a group with the same characteristics.

                                    It is still the case that information and options open to school leavers can often
                                    reinforce and
                                    perpetuate gender stereotypes. Employers, too, can fail to think beyond traditional
                                    recruiting
                                    patterns. These factors fuel female-male divisions in the workplace, entrenching
                                    outdated
                                    attitudes towards the jobs that are ‘suitable’ for each sex.

                                    and
                                    childcare tend to suffer the strongest gender segregation in the UK.
                                    Women make up 13% of the construction industry workforce, with 11.6% working in
                                    design and management and only 1% tradespeople.
                                    Only 3.5% of registered engineers are female.
                                    According to the Office for National Statistics, only 14.4% of ICT strategy,
                                    planning
                                    and software professionals are women.
                                    The vast majority of people working in childcare and early years provision are
                                    female.

                                    It’s been estimated that 1 in 20 people in the UK is a member of LGBTQIA+ community.
                                    Homophobia is a range of negative attitudes and feelings towards homosexuality and
                                    people
                                    identified or perceived as being homosexual. People who are homophobic can behave in
                                    an
                                    inappropriate way toward LGBQIA+ people without recognising that their behaviour is
                                    unwanted and
                                    perhaps even unlawful.
                                    This can present as people:
                                    being excluded
                                    being unable to express themselves as they would wish to
                                    not being given responsibility for tasks they are qualified to carry out
                                    having their opinions discounted
                                    Being subject to violence
