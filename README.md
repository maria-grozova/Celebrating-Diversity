##  1. Project Description

### Base Concept
This is a hackathon project for Code Institute, focusing on the development and building of a front-end website that seeks to provide advices, information and resources in the subject area of Diversity, Equality and Inclusion initiatives. 

The information within intends to provide instruction on the process of combatting discrimination, supporting marginalized communities and what being an effective ally means.

The goal of the site owner and our objective is to be able to provide this infromation in an accessible, informative way, with a strong focus on functional UI. 

## 2. Hackathon Project Rules and Guidelines

As part of a hackathon project, there are rules and constraints enforced upon the team for the design of this project. 

### Rules

- This project was coded over a 2.5 day period, covering 04/06/24 - 06/06/24.
- The only items permitted before this day were setting up a repository, wireframing, project team meetings and basic documentation. Coding could not begin until 9am of the first scheduled day.
- This project is _**not allowed**_ to use any form of JavaScript (outside of Bootstrap or similar CDN focused on basic style), and is not allowed to plug any APIs into the project. It is restricted to just HTML and CSS.

### Success Criteria

user experience design, accessibility and responsivity
- Test a Front-End web application through the development, implementation and 
deployment stages
- Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform
- Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation
- Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system 
such as GitHub
