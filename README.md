##  1. Project Description

### Base Concept
This is a hackathon project for Code Institute, focusing on the development and building of a front-end website that seeks to provide advices, information and resources in the subject area of Diversity, Equality and Inclusion initiatives. 

The information within intends to provide instruction on the process of combatting discrimination, supporting marginalized communities and what being an effective ally means.

The goal of the site owner and our objective is to be able to provide this infromation in an accessible, informative way, with a strong focus on functional UI. 

## 2. Hackathon Project Rules and Guidelines

As part of a hackathon project, there are rules and constraints enforced upon the team for the design of this project. 

### Rules

- This project was coded over a 2.5 day period, covering 04/06/24 - 06/06/24.
- The only items permitted before this day were setting up a repository, wireframing, project team meetings and basic documentation. Coding could not begin until 9am of the first scheduled day.
- This project is _**not allowed**_ to use any form of JavaScript (outside of Bootstrap or similar CDN focused on basic style), and is not allowed to plug any APIs into the project. It is restricted to just HTML and CSS.

### Success Criteria

- Design a static Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of 
user experience design, accessibility and responsivity
- Test a Front-End web application through the development, implementation and 
deployment stages
- Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform
- Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation
- Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system 
such as GitHub
- Use an Agile methodology to plan and design a Front End Web application

##  3. Background Research


##  4. Design Process

As part of our design process, we decided that our site needed to be clean in design principles, but also needed to be warm in aesthetic and tone. Crucially, it needed to have a mobile-first design. 

Our colour scheme would set the _initial tone_ of the site design, so we decided that confirming this issue first was important, as the colours would set the tone for future directions. 

We settled on two colour palettes for our site, using Coolors(https://coolors.co).

### Colour Palette 1

### Colour Palette 2

These two palettes were chosen for their visual simplicity, and their neutral, softer colour-coding. Ultimately, we decided to stick with **Colour Palette 1** as we felt that this gave a much warmer, more open toning to the website, making the viewer feel more welcomed to the site. Given the core focus of this project being a design around inclusivity, this was seen as a boon.

### Wireframing

With our colour-palette to hand, we decided that the next objective should be nailing down a core site-aesthetic, with a unified look that targets that mobile-first criteria. To achieve this, we used the UX wireframing tool, Balsamiq.

### Low Fidelity Frames

As you can see above, we designed our site with both mobile viewports and desktop viewports in mind. We did this, to give ourselves a firm idea of desired positioning between the two states. Our initial goal was trying to build content which best fit the mobile frame, and ideally it should default back to the desktop view responsively. 

We made an intentional decision at this stage to keep each page thematically distinct and clean, without cramming too much information into it. This was to ensure that our pages read cleanly, without too many images or objects drawing the attention of the user away from the intended content at the center.

### High Fidelity Frames
![image](https://github.com/maria-grozova/Celebrating-Diversity/assets/139562112/8f4de79e-b613-4184-85fa-6c55e25732e0)

For our high fidelity frames, we kept it very basic and simple. We added the colour-coding of our intended design, and then the images. 

As this comrpised the overwhelming majority of the styling changes that we needed to make per page, mostly being header and footer styling, we decided to restrict the time spent in wireframing stages and just present the homepage as an example of our intended design. 

This is because, even without images or content, our low fidelity wireframes still translated into effective code from image to terminal. All that was missing was the exact image, or wording in the content. The low fidelity edition already had the desired spacing, and that was what we anticipated the biggest hurdle may be. This proved to be a wise decision, as this was an accurate prediction and we were able to ensure that we had the necessary time to appropriately design the page containers due to this.


If more detail is desired, you may find our meeting minutes which also discuss our early design process. These can be found at the bottom of this README document.

### Coding the Site

The site was coded in HTML5, using CSS and Bootstrap v4.6. 

For our Navbar and Footer, two of the most crucial and consistent elements of the site, we called upon the Bootstrap CDN for template designs, and then styled it from there.

### Visual Example of Navbar

Code

Stylistically, we made some changes. We changed the colour coding to match our intended design, with our warm orange, contrasting with our preferred shade of white.


We also added hover-over functionality to the text, to ensure that it now reflects an active state:

To achieve some of these desired changes, we had to make mass-override commands for Bootstrap's default scheming, which would override whatever CSS instruction we gave. This took a bit of experimentation, however, we eventually overcame this obstable by targeting every Bootstrap element.

### Visual Example of Footer

By contrast, the Footer was significantly easier to put together. This largely comprised of incorporating our intended style with some CSS, and then making some small adjustments to padding and borders.

##  5. How to Use Celebrating Diversity

The use and functionality of Celebrating Diversity was designed to be as simplistic as possible from the get-go. Due to our focus of inclusivity, we recognised that this website needed to be as simplistic in terms of UX as possible, to be as inclusive as possible.

Due to this, we have a single primary mechanism of navigation around the site, the navbar. When in mobile view, this collapses to a navbar collapse-down, when on desktop it appears as an array of links arranged to the right of the screen. Our brand identity will always take the user back to the home page.

With this, we have a simple, but elegant mechanism of site navigation, reliant wholly upon the intuitive use of the Navbar, which users at this point are trained to understand.

On our About page, we have an Accordion element, from Bootstrap. This can be used to collapse out additional information, to give the user great information about each specific form of discrimination.

On our Contact page, we have a contact form, so that users may get in touch to provide us with insights and information they wish for our site to contain.

On our Take Action page, we have included an iframe for a video. This will simply play an example video of what it means to be inclusive.

On our Resources page, we have a link repository to guide the user to other locations and sites (each with an "_blank" element), which will direct them to further avenues by which they can make push for an agenda of diversity and inclusion.

There are errors in the Take Action page. Unfortunately, we do not currently understand how to 'fix' this iframe issue. 

### CSS

There is a remnant redundant CSS line for home-content-text, which will be removed. There are wrong syntax elements for resources-title and contact-title.
